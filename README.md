# Tetris3D (Deprecated)   
This project has been shut down.   
You can fork lastest commit of master but it doesn't contain dozens of features.   
Latest features are contained in Effect02 branch but it will cause a lot of errors in scripts.   
My project Tetri3D is on the construction. ([link](https://github.com/jcy9503/Tetri3D))
